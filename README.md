A Mandelbrot Fractal visulizer using java, with panning in functionalities.

The term Mandelbrot set is used to refer both to a general class of fractal sets and to a particular instance of such a set. In general, a Mandelbrot set marks the set of points in the complex plane such that the corresponding Julia set is connected and not computable.

"The" Mandelbrot set is the set obtained from the quadratic recurrence equation

 z_(n+1)=z_n^2+C 	
(1)
with z_0=C, where points C in the complex plane for which the orbit of z_n does not tend to infinity are in the set. Setting z_0 equal to any point in the set that is not a periodic point gives the same result. The Mandelbrot set was originally called a mu molecule by Mandelbrot. J. Hubbard and A. Douady proved that the Mandelbrot set is connected.
